    "1. Add a temporal dimension to the data/model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spiking models always run over time (i.e., each forward pass through the model will run for some number of timesteps). This means that we need to add a temporal dimension to the data, so instead of having shape ``(batch_size, ...)`` it will have shape\n",
    "``(batch_size, n_steps, ...)``. For those familiar with working with RNNs, the principles are the same; a spiking neuron accepts temporal data and computes over time, just like an RNN.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "``keras_spiking.SpikingActivation`` can encapsulate any activation function, and will produce an equivalent spiking implementation. Neurons will spike at a rate proportional to the output of the base activation function. For example, if the activation function is outputting a value of 10, then the wrapped ``SpikingActivation`` will output spikes at a rate of 10Hz (i.e., 10 spikes per 1 simulated second, where 1 simulated second is equivalent to some number of timesteps, determined by the ``dt`` parameter of ``SpikingActivation``).\n",

For example, ``tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10, activation=\"relu\")`` is equivalent to ``tf.keras.layers.Dense(units=10) -> tf.keras.layers.Activation(\"relu\")``. Due to the temporal nature of ``SpikingActivation`` it cannot be directly used within another layer as in the first case; we need to explicitly separate it into its own layer."

    "\n",
    "To help understand why, we need to think more about the temporal nature of spiking neurons. Recall that the layer is set up such that if the base activation function were to be outputting a value of 1, the spiking equivalent would be spiking at 1Hz (i.e., emitting one spike per second). In the above example we are simulating for 10 timesteps, with the default ``dt`` of 0.001s, so we're simulating a total of 0.01s. If our neurons aren't spiking very rapidly, and we're only simulating for 0.01s, then it's not surprising that we aren't getting any spikes in that time window.\n",

To understand why this improves accuracy, keep in mind that although the simulated time is increasing, the actual number of timesteps is still 10 in all cases. We're effectively binning all the spikes that occur on each time step. So as our bin sizes get larger (increasing `dt`), the spike counts will more closely approximate the \"true\" output of the underlying non-spiking activation function.\n",

But keep in mind that when we do that we have likely lost any of the advantages that were motivating us to investigate spiking models in the first place. For example, one prominent advantage of spiking models is temporal sparsity (we only need to communicate occasional spikes, rather than continuous values). However, with large `dt` the neurons are likely spiking every simulation time step (or multiple times per timestep), so the activity is no longer temporally sparse.\n",

Specifically, we will use the spiking activation on the forward pass, while still using the non-spiking version on the backwards pass.

    "Another tool we can employ when working with SpikingActivation layers is filtering. As we've seen, the output of a spiking layer consists of discrete, temporally sparse spike events. This makes it difficult to determine the spike rate of a neuron when just looking at a single timestep. For example, in the cases above we are only using the output on the final timestep to compute the test accuracy. But it's possible that a neuron that actually has a low spike rate just happened to spike on that final timestep, throwing off our measured results.\n",

    "It seems natural then, rather than just looking at a single timestep, to compute some kind of moving average of the spiking output across timesteps. This is effectively what filtering is doing. KerasSpiking contains a Lowpass layer, which implements a [lowpass filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-pass_filter). This has a parameter `tau`, known as the filter time constant, which controls the degree of smoothing the layer will apply. Larger `tau` values will apply more smoothing, meaning that we're aggregating information across longer periods of time, but the output will also be slower to adapt to changes in the input.\n",

    "We can use `SpikingActivation` layers to convert any activation function to an equivalent spiking implementation. Models with SpikingActivations can be trained and evaluated in the same way as non-spiking models, thanks to the swappable training/inference behaviour.\n",

    "- [Simulation time](#Simulation-time): by adjusting `dt` we can trade off temporal sparsity versus accuracy\n",
    "- [Spiking aware training](#Spiking-aware-training): incorporating spiking dynamics on the forward pass can allow the model to learn weights that are more robust to spiking activations\n",
    "- [Spike rate regularization](#Spike-rate-regularization): we can gain more control over spike rates by directly incorporating activity regularization into the optimization process\n",
    "- [Lowpass filtering](#Lowpass-filtering): we can achieve better accuracy with fewer spikes by aggregating spike data over time"
