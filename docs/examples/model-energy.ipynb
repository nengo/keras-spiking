    "provided by KerasSpiking should be taken as very rough estimates only, and they rely on\n",
    "a number of assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Device specifications**: In order to estimate the energy used by a model on a\n",
    "particular device, we need to know how much energy is used per synaptic operation/neuron\n",
    "update. We rely on published data for these numbers (see our sources for\n",
    "[CPU/GPU/ARM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7054508),\n",
    "[Loihi](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322548911_Loihi_A_Neuromorphic_Manycore_Processor_with_On-Chip_Learning),\n",
    "and [SpiNNaker 1/2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.08941)). Energy numbers in practice can\n",
    "differ significantly from published results.\n",
    "- **Overhead**: We do not account for any overhead in the energy estimates (e.g., the\n",
    "cost of transferring data on and off a device). We only estimate the energy usage of\n",
    "internal model computations (synaptic operations and neuron updates). In practice,\n",
    "overhead can be a significant contributor to the energy usage of a model.\n",
    "- **Spiking implementation**: When estimating the energy usage for spiking devices,\n",
    "such as Loihi and Spinnaker, we assume that the model being estimated can be fully\n",
    "converted to a spiking implementation for deployment on the device\n",
