Examples
========

These examples can be found in the ``<keras-spiking>/docs/examples`` directory
(where ``<keras-spiking>`` is the location of the KerasSpiking package).  The
examples are Jupyter notebooks; if you would like to run them yourself, refer to
the `Jupyter documentation <https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Alternatively, you can use
`Google Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/nengo/keras-spiking/>`_
to run the examples online.  Note that when running on Colab you will need to add the
line ``!pip install keras-spiking[docs]`` at the top of each notebook, in order to
install the necessary requirements.
